# 30 Days of openFrameworks
Hello! This is a wip readme/progress log. I will be structuring a path for myself to get started with openFrameworks, and I will be documenting it in this repo. My initial plan is to get started with translating some of my Processing sketches to C++, while also picking up stuff from the following resources:
- [OpenFrameworks official online book](https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/foreword.html)

  - [X] [Philosophy](https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/of_philosophy.html) finished on 2018-August-25
  - [X] [C++ Language Basics abridged](https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/cplusplus_basics.html) finished on 2018-August-25
