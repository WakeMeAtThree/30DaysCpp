# 30 Days of openFrameworks
Hello! This is a wip readme/progress log. I will be structuring a path for myself to get started with openFrameworks, and I will be documenting it in this repo. My initial plan is to get started with translating some of my Processing sketches to C++, and add some real time interactivity with it. I'm coming at this being a long time Python + Java user.
