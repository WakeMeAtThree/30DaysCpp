# 30 Days Of openFrameworks
Hello! This is a wip readme. I will be structuring a path for myself to get started with openFrameworks, and I will be documenting it in this repo. My initial plan is to get started with translating some of my Processing sketches to C++, while also picking up stuff from the following resources:
- [OpenFrameworks official online book](https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/foreword.html)
- [Cpp getting started](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/)
